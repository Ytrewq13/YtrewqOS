# Project proposal

4 Pages of A4 paper (4 Sides)

## Required parts

* Project Title
  * Name of project
  * Module Code/name
  * Name / student ID
  * Supervisor name
* External Aspect
  * Contribution to knowledge
* Aims and objectives
  * "My aim in this project is to ..."
  * "In order to achieve this aim, I will ... collect, construct, produce, test,
  trial, measure, document, pilot, deconstruct, analyse ..."
* Work Plan
  * Tasks to be carried out
  * Deliverables & Key dates
  * The time plan should be realistic and should take into account other
  commitments (exam periods, coursework deadlines, holidays, etc.).
* Bibliography
  * Core references should be included to support the arguments/background
  provided in the proposal.
  * In general, 4 - 10 references is usually a good amount.

## Components of a good project proposal

* Good technical writing skill (clarity of the proposal, appropriate use of
technical language, etc.).
* Appropriateness of the aim & objectives.
* Indication of knowledge on the subject area (e.g. references).
* Indication of critical thinking (e.g. need for the study, specificity of the
objectives, etc.).
* Quality of the work plan.

## Covid-19

* Be prepared for a worsening situation
* Assess all threats to the completion of the project work, and take
precautions to minimise the risks.
* Don't have to explicitly discuss Covid-19 situation in the proposal.

## The Work Plan

* See what is involved in doing the project: is the project feasible.
* Needs to be concrete enough.
  * See how much work is required for each part of the project.
  * Know exactly what different stages are required for the project.

## Planning the project

Need to achieve the objectives.

* Work breakdown
  * Split project into different stages (Literature survey, develop RPi OS,
  Write dissertation, etc.).
  * Add detail to each stage with the parts you expect will take time (e.g.
  Bootloader, shell, memory manager, process manager, disk IO, etc.).
* Don't identify tasks which take less than a week to complete.

## Activity sequencing

* Evaluate the tasks
  * Determine which tasks depend on others / which can be completed
  independently.
* Sequence the tasks onto different paths.
  * The most critical tasks become the "Critical path". If any task on this
  path is delayed, the whole project will be delayed.
* Create a Gantt chart with the paths in parallel whenever possible.
  * Remember that when 2 tasks are in parallel, they will each take twice as
  long to complete.
